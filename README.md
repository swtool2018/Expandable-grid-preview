# Expandable-grid-preview
A grid of expandable images, similar to Google Image Search.

Features:
Icon Thumbnails show expanding preview and row of picture thumbnails.
Picture thumbnails show expanding preview.
Need a help on my this project that the first expanded preview should remain open when second preview opens.
See WhatWeDo.html to get a sense for how this works.

Based on Thumbnail Images with expanding preview article on codrops.
